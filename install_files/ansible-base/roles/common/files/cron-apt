# Regular cron jobs for the cron-apt package
#

# Every night at 4:00 AM run cron-apt, then reboot.
# Note that cron-apt sleeps for 0-60 minutes when run
# noninteractively (e.g. in this cronjob), so the actual
# start time may be as late as 5:00 AM. Only reboot
# if cron-apt exited successfully, so broken or partially
# installed packages don't cause problems with booting.
